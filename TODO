TODO list
*******************

- The end() method inside the CollectBall class, I may need to overwrite it in order to accept different ending scienario (depending on the option)
-----------------------------------

In general:
*************

- I must cluster the traces I have, and interpret the clustering results. I expect for example that I for 4 clusters I see a ball, a switch, a basket and a wall representative clusters.
- For the online learning of the options, there is an issue: Do I update the policy of the option I select only? Or I update the policy of all the options at each
    time step (in case I am in a legal position that allows me to select these options)?
- What I want to do now is to take a hard look at "SarsaNN" and "Policy", and see how can I replace the following data structures:
  - DAction
  - ActionTemplate
  - DState

- I need to replace the 'param' class (defined inside sferes2) with another simple structure inside 'sml'
- I also want to get rid of the 'policy' class. I want everything to be inside SarsaNN
- I need to combine both options and primitive actions into one container --> or should I? Since I've the correct numbering, and it is all integers, I just need to put the correct
if conditions.
- What are the inputs I need for the RL_run2 class:
	-- FIXED: game playground
	-- FIXED: 
	-- Instance of the game simulator
	-- Reward function number --> choose which reward you can get here
	-- 

- Till now, all of this is based on 'no history'. I need to add the history later
